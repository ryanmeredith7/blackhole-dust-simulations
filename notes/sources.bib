    abstract = {
        We derive effective equations with loop quantum gravity corrections for the
        Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi family of space-times, and use these to study quantum
        gravity effects in the Oppenheimer–Snyder collapse model. For this model,
        after the formation of a black hole with an apparent horizon, quantum gravity
        effects become important in the space-time region where the energy density
        and space-time curvature scalars become comparable to the Planck scale.
        These quantum gravity effects first stop the collapse of the dust matter
        field when its energy density reaches the Planck scale, and then cause the
        dust field to begin slowly expanding. Due to this continued expansion, the
        matter field will eventually extend beyond the apparent horizon, at which
        point the horizon disappears and there is no longer a black hole. There are
        no singularities anywhere in this space-time. In addition, in the limit that
        edge effects are neglected, we show that the dynamics for the interior of
        the star of uniform energy density follow the loop quantum cosmology
        effective Friedman equation for the spatially flat
        Friedman–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker space-time. Finally, we estimate the
        lifetime of the black hole, as measured by a distant observer, to be
        ∼(GM)2/ℓ Pl.
